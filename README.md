# DWWM EvalCCP1

### Developement

No framework has been used to create this project.<br>
It was developed in HTML, CSS and JS over the course of a week, from October 24 to 27 2023. Images used are in .png or .svg formats.<br>
A mockup was also created with Figma and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/zBga6gWuWuNovEVuq3rIvO/DWWM-CCF1?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=zuha3j9BZ8AjjCCM-1).

### Functionalities

This project was carried out as part of the DWWM training and had as its subject the creation of the front-end part of a forum on the topic of my choice.<br>
I based mine on the Mercenary work off the Cyberpunk 2077 universe and followed the "Kitsch" aesthetic that can be found in it.<br>
The functionalities off this forum include :

- responsivity ;
- both register and login pages (as it is only a local project the LocalStorage is used) ;
- the possibility to create new discussions treads and to add new awnsers to those discussions, both displaying the time of creation and the author.
